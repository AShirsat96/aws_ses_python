Using Python and AWS SDK, send email using AWS Simple Email Service

Step 1: Create an AWS account if you don't have one. 

Step 2: Once you have created your AWS account, log in.

Step 3: You need to set up your SES account. You must add your email address and domain to set up your account.

Step 4: Once you have added your email address, you will need an verification email and your email address will get verified.

Step 5: You can start sending test emails from your email address. In case you want to send a custom email address, you will have to add a new identity and get that email
address verified. (In a sandbox environment, all your identities created need to be verified)

Step 6: Create an IAM user and attach the policy giving complete SES access

Step 7: Once you have created an IAM user, you need to create your access keys
